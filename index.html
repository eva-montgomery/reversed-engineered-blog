                <h1>AUTOZONE HOURS</h1>
                    <p>Car issues are often a headache especially for the typical automotive-naive person, and they may want somewhere to go for advice or to buy a part themselves before going to an expensive mechanic.  AutoZone employees, often referred to as “AutoZoners” can typically be seen in their bright red shirts outside of any AutoZone store helping a customer with their various automobile problems or inside the store on the computer with a customer looking up parts or researching a possible diagnosis or solution for customer’s car troubles. Whether you need a new CV Axle, a new tail light, or just want to know why your check engine light is on, <strong>AutoZone</strong> is the one-stop-shop for everything automobile and car-part related.
                    </p>
            
                    <p><strong>AutoZone</strong> hours can be a very important topic, especially for someone who’s car seems to be acting up at an inconvenient time and needs some TLC from someone who knows cars and car parts as soon as possible. For most locations during the weekdays, AutoZone is <strong>open</strong> bright and early on weekdays at 7:30 AM and will <strong>close</strong> to customers at 10:00 PM on Monday through Friday. During the Weekends, AutoZone will be open from 7:30 AM through 10:00 PM as well. The last day of the week is slightly different and typically AutoZone hours on Sunday are 8:30 AM to 9:00 PM. AutoZone store hours may vary by location and the typical volume of customers; some rural stores may close at earlier time and some AutoZone stores run 24-hours. Check out the table below for a quick visual for the typical <strong>AutoZone hours of operation</strong>.</p>
